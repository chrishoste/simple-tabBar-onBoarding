# Simple onboarding for a TabBar

> This was created during my [quarantine challenges](https://github.com/chrishoste/quarantine-challenge). Check out the more stuff I did during this time.

## Design
After some exploring on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) I decided to go for an `Onboarding`-Design [(see link)](https://dribbble.com/shots/6833910-Mobile-App-Onboarding). 

## My final implementation

Of course it is not a 1:1 implementation, but it approaches well and because of the time limit there is a lack of small animations. These can still be implemented in time.
