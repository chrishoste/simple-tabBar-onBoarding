# Simple onboarding for a TabBar
> During the quarantine I challenged myself to pick out some designs on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and then try to implement them in Swift to keep myself busy. I did not set myself any requirements in quality or anything like that. The only thing is that I have to be able to implement it in a day or less (depending on how much time I have). Status will then be pushed to GitHub without further ado. Projects may or may not be developed further later.

- Number 2: [Printerest like floating Tab Bar](https://github.com/chrishoste/printeres-tabbar)

## Design
After some exploring on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) I decided to go for an `Onboarding`-Design [(see link)](https://dribbble.com/shots/6833910-Mobile-App-Onboarding). 

## My final implementation

Of course it is not a 1:1 implementation, but it approaches well and because of the time limit there is a lack of small animations. These can still be implemented in time.
